## What is activation for?
The trial version of the operating system is free to download. You can get it from Microsoft.com or third-party sites. However, it won’t be the full version without a license. The trial version limits personalization and shows annoying expiration messages. Activating it on time allows you to:
- Remove all watermarks and warnings that interfere with normal operation;
- Get access to 100% of the operating system features;
- Change the desktop wallpaper, customize the appearance of shortcuts, folders, and make other changes to the visual part of the OS.
Access to all these features gives activator Windows 11 KMSAuto, distributed for free and compatible with all builds and modifications of the latest OS from Microsoft. You can download it via a direct link from our website.
## Windows 11 Pro Activator: what are the advantages?
Instead of dubious “no-name” activators, use a reliable and proven option – KMS. Everyone knows this name, and the utility has been successfully used for many years in all civilized countries, including Microsoft’s home country – the United States. The main advantages of this activator include:

⦁ Access to Full Features

The activation process for Windows 11 helps the OS to offer users all functionalities with advanced features that are unavailable by default. Advanced features include protection for your data by BitLocker Encryption and a Windows Hello biometric authentication system.

Added benefits involve productivity tools enriched through Virtual Desktops and improved multitasking capabilities among users. Most of these facilities do not come into play with the activation of the OS, thus crippling the experience and functionality of the operating system.

⦁ Enhanced Security

A fully activated Windows 11 protects you by downloading all critical security updates made by Microsoft: updates for the essential protection of your system against viruses and malware.

The updates to guard the system from potential threats are the specifications of advanced security that get activated, such as Windows Defender, to protect many other systems that cannot protect from malware.

Windows Defender is always running in the background to fight malware and can initiate on-demand scans of the system. When not activated, you are subjected to most security risks —severe patches and updates will save your data and privacy.

⦁ Better Performance

An activation copy of Windows 11 runs significantly quicker than one that has not been activated, as it sheds limitations and interruptions.

Since this eliminates those reminders and notifications that modulate working smoothness, the PC can work to its best; it can provide a highly responsive user experience.

So doing so will also bring fewer issues with software and hardware, which could have been experienced with an unactivated system.

⦁ Lack of monetization

You can download the program absolutely free of charge

⦁ Portability

KMS does not need to be installed, and it runs immediately after downloading/unpacking;
